Note: Official builds of master branch and releases are https://ziglang.org/download/[available for download].

When using a package manager, it is best to use a tagged release rather than
using an option to install a development version.

See https://repology.org/project/zig/versions[Repology] for an overview of which package management systems and operating systems Zig has already been packaged for, and what the current packaged version is.
