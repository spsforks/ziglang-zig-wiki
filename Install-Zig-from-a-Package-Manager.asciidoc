Note: Official builds of master branch and releases are https://ziglang.org/download/[available for download].

When using a package manager, it is best to use a tagged release rather than
using an option to install a development version.

See https://repology.org/project/zig/versions[Repology] for an overview of which package management systems and operating systems Zig has already been packaged for, and what the current packaged version is.

this package can be used since it has no llvm dependency.
