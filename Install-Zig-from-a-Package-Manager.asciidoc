Note: Official builds of master branch and releases are https://ziglang.org/download/[available for download].

When using a package manager, it is best to use a tagged release rather than
using an option to install a development version.

See https://repology.org/project/zig/versions[Repology] for an overview of which package management systems and operating systems Zig has already been packaged for, and what the current packaged version is.

This package uses the official `ziglang.org` static build instead of building against source. +

In the event that the llvm version in `[extra]` is not up to date with the latest version used by Zig,
this package can be used since it has no llvm dependency.
