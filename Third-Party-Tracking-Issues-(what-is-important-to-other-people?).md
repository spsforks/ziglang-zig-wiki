This wiki page is intended to collect third party tracking issues so that Zig contributors can understand what Zig issues are high priority for other people. There should be one link per project. Use this to communicate to the Zig team, what issues in particular are affecting your project(s). On the other side of the link, anything goes, you can even just say stuff like "compiler is too slow".

This list is *unordered*. Please add new items to the **bottom**.
