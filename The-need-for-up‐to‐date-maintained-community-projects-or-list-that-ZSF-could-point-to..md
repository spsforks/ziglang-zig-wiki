There's a need for Zig projects to be maintained in a better manner than what we have now. A lot of projects are outdated, poorly maintained, target different versions of Zig. There has to be a guideline that zig project maintainers should follow for their projects to be "reputable" community projects.
This change will help lay initial base for Open Source Zig Community Software that users will be able to use standalone or include their projects easily.
It can also be a List of Reputable Community Projects, maintained by ZSF(the list), that show good Zig programming practices and maintenance.

What we have now is a mess of projects, that are very difficult to use and include into your projects.

What is could be the guideline?
Target latest release.
Don't create an unnecessary complex/unusual build.zig.
Include easy instructions to build the library/executable if the build process is more complex than running zig build.

What could the criteria for a project to be included into List of Reputable Community Projects.
Major feature complete. The project has enough features implemented to feel complete. Undone/0.1 version projects are not a fit.
Ease of use and building.

This will be somewhat covered by package manager for libraries at least.

What this solves:
It fills the void of practical projects available for Zig community to start experimenting with, examining source code.
