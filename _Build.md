Summary:

I would like to propose the addition of a method to install Zig on macOS using a .pkg installer. This would provide a more streamlined installation process for macOS users, making it easier to set up Zig in their development environments.

Motivation:

Currently, installing Zig on macOS typically involves using Homebrew or manually downloading the binaries. While these methods are effective, providing a .pkg installer would simplify the installation process for users who prefer a more traditional installation method, similar to other development tools on macOS.

Proposed Implementation:

    Create a .pkg installer that includes all necessary binaries and files for Zig.
    Include a script for setting up the environment (e.g., updating the PATH variable) to ensure that Zig can be easily accessed from the terminal.
    Provide documentation on how to use the .pkg installer, including instructions for both installation and uninstallation.

Benefits:

    Simplifies the installation process for new users.
    Aligns with standard macOS practices for software installation.
    Reduces barriers to entry for developers looking to use Zig.

Thank you for considering this proposal. I believe that adding a .pkg installation method will enhance the user experience for Zig on macOS.
